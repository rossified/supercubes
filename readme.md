# Supercubes

LGPL 3.0

Supercubes is a small and simple OpenSCAD library that amends the software's base primitives with additional arguments, such as the ability to align "cubes" and "rectangles" along any axis and to add bevels and radii. Work on this library is in-progress. A previous version had been released under the name CubeTools.
